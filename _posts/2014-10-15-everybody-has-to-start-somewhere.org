* A way to react.
The other day I got my ass kicked during a fairly easy and short technical screening for a developer position. 
The question was really not hard but I got stuck and the stress wasn't helping my focus. So since the whole 
purpose me posting  here is to keep track of what I do in order to get better at what I do (and also finding a job).

** Interview process. 

Technical screenings are a pretty simple concept, you get a phone call from an engineer and you got asked some technical questions. 
Sometimes it's just questions, and sometimes you have an online code editor.
